# TP4 Archi_Dis 
## **gRPC Web Services**

### **Project Overview**
This project is the fourth assignment (TP4) for the course **HAI704I** at the **University of Montpellier**. It involves implementing a **hotel reservation system** using **gRPC web services**, which is designed to be scalable and distributed. 

The first step is to replicate the implementation from **TP2** or **TP3**, but using **gRPC** instead of **REST** or **SOAP** ([Link to TP2 SOAP](https://github.com/malik-mnsr/TP2_Archi_Dis_SOAP)), ([Link to TP3 REST](https://github.com/malik-mnsr/TP3_Archi_Dis_REST)) 

Additionally, a **web service** will be created to **compare prices** from different agencies and display them on the **command-line interface (CLI)**. This will allow clients to choose the best offer before making a reservation.

### **High-Level Architecture**

The implementation is divided into three main parts:
